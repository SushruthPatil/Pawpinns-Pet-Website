# Pawpinns-Pet-Website
As a college assignment for 6th sem, I built this multi-page pet website which includes register/login, home, about, services provided, booking and contact section.
The front-end is built with html and css and the back-end using Flask.
The data is made to be stored in the database and used for retrieving for login or updated the newly registered users and also to store in the booking made by the users.
